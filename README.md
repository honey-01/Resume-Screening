# Resume-Screening
The recruitment process is a critical component of any organization, and one of the most time-consuming and challenging aspects of it is screening resumes.
The problem is that the current resume screening process is often manual and subjective, which leads to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. 
This approach can also result in the possibility of missing out on highly qualified candidates due to human error, bias, and limitations of time.
